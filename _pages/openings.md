# Open positions

The Hydroinformatics Group at the University of Virginia is seeking applications for one or more undergraduate and graduate research assistants.

Our lab uses computing to advance understanding of water systems. Openings are available for students interested in research in water resources engineering or in applying data science and software engineering to water systems. We especially seek students with experience using Python, R, and GIS, but experience with these tools is not required. Students in civil and environmental engineering, computer science, computer engineering, systems engineering, and environmental science are encouraged to apply.

Interested applicants should send a cover letter and resume to Professor Jon Goodall (goodall@virginia.edu).
