### An Interactive Software Infrastructure for Sustaining Collaborative Community Innovation in the Hydrologic Sciences

Sponsor - National Science Foundation
Role - Co-PI
PI - David Tarboton, Utah State

Water, its quality, quantity, accessibility, and management, is crucial to society.
However, our ability to model and quantitatively understand the complex interwoven
environmental processes that control water and its availability is severely hampered
by inadequate tools related to hydrologic data discovery, systems integration, modeling/
simulation, and education. This project develops sustainable cyberinfrastructure
for better access to water-related data and models in the hydrologic sciences, enabling
hydrologists and other associated communities to collaborate and combine data and
models from multiple sources. It will provide new ways in which hydrologic knowledge
is created and applied to better understand water availability, quality, and dynamics.
It will also help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions
between natural and engineered aspects of the water cycle. These goals will be achieved
through the development of interoperable cyberinfrastructure tools and the creation
of an online collaborative environment, called HydroShare, which enables scientists
to easily discover and access hydrologic and related data and models, retrieve them
to their desktop, and perform analyses in a high performance computing environment.
The software to be developed will take advantage of existing NSF cyberinfrastructure
(iRODS, HUBzero, CSDMS, CUAHSI HIS) and be created as open source code. Its development
will be end user-driven. In terms of broader impacts, the project builds essential
infrastructure for science by developing software tools and computing environments
to allow better understanding of the impacts of climate change (i.e., floods, droughts,
biofuels, etc.) and to allow improved water resource development and the management
of freshwater resources both above and below ground.
